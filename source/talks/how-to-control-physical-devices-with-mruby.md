## Talk Abstract

Let's control physical devices using mruby on your board!

mruby has not been released yet, but you don't have to wait for it. 
Current mruby is good enough for prototyping or learing.

If you have cheap microcontroller boards like STM32F4Discovery or Raspberry Pi, 
you can run mruby on them and control physical devices, without other computers 
to control them. And if you have right mrbgems, what you need is writing 
small Ruby code, neither C nor assembler.

In this session, we will talk about how to use mruby and how to create 
and use mrbgems so as to controll LEDs, buttons, accelerometer and so on.
