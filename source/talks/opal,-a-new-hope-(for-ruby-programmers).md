## Talk Abstract

--- 
A short time ago, in an internet not far away ...

It is a period of Javascript revolution. Rebel Ruby coders, striking 
from an obscure repository, have won significant victories against 
evil Javascript Empire.

During the battle, Rebel Ruby coders have managed to duplicate the 
Empire's ultimate weapon, the use of the same language on both server and
client sides, but this time with a language with enough meta programming 
power to make the most elegant DSLs on the planet.

Pursued by myriad Javascript options, the Rebel Coders race home to 
their repositories, custodian of the code that can save their people and 
restore freedom to Ruby Coders everywhere.

Do you have mixed feelings about the Javascript Revolution? It is a 
truly exciting time with many options and opportunities. 
Unfortunately, the language of this revolution is Javascript.

“Javascript is the path to the dark side. Javascript leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.” 
- Yoda, if he were a coder

With all this Javascript goodness, what's a Ruby programmer to do? One 
word - Opal. Opal is a source to source ruby to javascript compiler, 
corelib and a runtime implementation that currently passes 1716 
rubyspecs w/a reachable goal of passing them all.

You might be thinking, yet another language that compiles down to 
Javascript. Why should you as a Ruby Coder board care?

Matz once wrote: 
"For me the purpose of life is partly to have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, So Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."

As another Ruby, Opal is designed to make programmer's happy

Here's the top 8 reasons why Opal will make you, the Ruby programmer, happy 
1. It's just Ruby, and a viable one 
2. Greenspun's 10th Rule, Opal Edition 
3. Solves things the Ruby way, making the programmer happy 
4. Frameworks, we don't need no stinking frameworks (but we have some) 
5. Tools you already know and love 
6. Easy integration with Ruby web frameworks 
7. Awesome In Browser tools 
8. New possibilities

This talk will go over those 8 reasons and more. There will be live code demonstrations.

Opal, this might just be the droid you're looking for.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss Javascript goodbye. Coming a computer near you.
